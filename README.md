# Intro

Writing 3D transformations in different libraries is very confusing. This small repo compares the syntax, results, and difference between the following three libraries:

- glm
- Eigen
- trackball.c - A small library for interactive 3D rotations

# Licence

The code in glm-vs-eigen.cc is given to the public domain.
